Open Source Battery Module System

BM-SYS is an investigation on the current state of lithium technology and the resulting environmental dangers. 
The output of this research is a battery module system powered by li-ion cells that changes the way power 
approaches electronic devices.With a single module that adapts itself thanks to the help of USB Power 
Delivery technology, is possible to share the same energy source though all our daily use battery powered devices. 
Futhermore the addition of a raw power output through and XT-30 connector enables the modules to be used a 
quick-swappable power source for electric vehicles.
The result of this approach is a detachable open-source lithium battery that can be easily serviced, repaired, 
and upgraded. To express the capabilities of the modules, a small family of objects has been designed: 
a lamp module, a Bluetooth speaker, and an electric skateboard.
